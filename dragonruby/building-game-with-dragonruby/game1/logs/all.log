* WARNING: Method invocation on a nil value detected.
The method ~-~ with args [132] was invoked on ~grid~ within args.state, but ~grid~ has a
value of nil (the invocation of ~-~ was suppressed). Consider setting
a default value for ~grid~ to avoid null reference exceptions later on."



To track method invocations on ~nil~, add $gtk.trace_nil_punning! in =main.rb=.
