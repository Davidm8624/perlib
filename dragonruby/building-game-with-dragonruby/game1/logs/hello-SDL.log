- [Game] * EXCEPTION POSSIBLY CAUSED BY CALLING ~gtk.reset~: maybe use ~$gtk.reset_next_tick~ instead.
An exception occurred soon after ~$gtk.reset~ was invoked.

Keep in mind that ~$gtk.reset~ doesn't stop the rest of your ~tick~ method from being invoked.

You may have attempted to interact with properties on ~args.state~ that no longer have a value.

There are a few ways to fix exceptions that fall into this category:

1. Wherever you are using ~$gtk.reset~ within ~tick~, replace
   with ~$gtk.reset_next_tick~ (this function will tell DragonRuby to
   reset on the next frame before invoking your ~tick~ method).
2. Anywhere you are using ~$gtk.reset~, immediately set default values for
   properties on ~args.state~ that are needed to complete the execution
   of the rest of your ~tick~ function successfully.
3. Do not use ~$gtk.reset~ and instead create a function that reinitializes your game
   and ensures it has a consistent/valid state.

   Take a look at the following sample apps for insights on how to do this:
   - =./samples/99_genre_boss_battle/boss_battle_game_jam/app/main.rb=
   - =./samples/99_genre_platformer/shadows/app/main.rb=

** NOTE:
The options above are ordered by quickest to implement (but probably not
bulletproof), to more work to implement (but a better design long term).
